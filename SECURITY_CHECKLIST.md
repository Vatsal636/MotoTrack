- [ ] Backup stored offsite
- [ ] Recovery procedure documented

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Page load times acceptable (<3 seconds)

## Security Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Change all passwords immediately
   - Review recent activity logs
   - Check for unauthorized database changes
   - Disable compromised accounts

2. **Investigation**
   - Review all logs from past 30 days
   - Check for suspicious file modifications
   - Verify database integrity
   - Check for malware/backdoors

3. **Remediation**
   - Apply security patches
   - Remove any malicious code
   - Restore from clean backup if needed
   - Update all credentials

4. **Prevention**
   - Identify how breach occurred
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update security procedures
   - Consider security audit by professional
