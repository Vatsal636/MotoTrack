## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Going Live

### Must Complete These Steps:

#### 1. Database Setup ⚠️ NOT YET DONE
```bash
# You need to import the database schema
# Option A: Using phpMyAdmin
   - Go to phpMyAdmin
   - Select database: if0_40155593_mototrack
   - Click Import
   - Choose file: database/schema.sql
   - Click Go

# Option B: Using command line (if available)
mysql -h sql201.infinityfree.com -u if0_40155593 -p if0_40155593_mototrack < database/schema.sql
```

#### 2. Change Default Admin Password ⚠️ CRITICAL
```
After importing database:
1. Go to: https://mototrack.rf.gd/login.php
2. Login with: admin / admin123
3. Go to Profile
4. Change to STRONG password (16+ chars recommended)

⚠️ SECURITY RISK: Default password is publicly known!
```

#### 3. Test All Security Features
Follow the checklist in `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`:
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Test rate limiting (try 6 wrong passwords)
- [ ] Test session timeout (wait 1 hour)
- [ ] Test password validation
- [ ] Verify .env is not accessible via browser

#### 4. Enable HTTPS Redirect (When SSL is Active)
Edit `.htaccess` and uncomment these lines:
```apache
# Force HTTPS (uncomment in production if you have SSL)
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```
